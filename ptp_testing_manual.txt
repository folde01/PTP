PTP testing manual

PTP unit tests can be found in the files ptp_test_*.py

These have main functions can be run like this:

python ./ptp_test_session_pair.py

One exception is ptp_test_sniffer.py. Use this wrapper for it to run the sniffer tests: ptp_test_sniffer.sh.

Before you do, you'll need to have the virtual device running, or the stop() function won't stop the sniffer, due to a bug. Following the instructions in the user manual for starting up a virtual Target Device.
